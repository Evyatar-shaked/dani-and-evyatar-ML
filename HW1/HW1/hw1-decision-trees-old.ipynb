    "\n",
    "1. This jupyter notebook contains all the step by step instructions needed for this exercise.\n",
    "1. Write **efficient vectorized** code whenever possible. Some calculations in this exercise take several minutes when implemented efficiently, and might take much longer otherwise. Unnecessary loops will result in point deduction.\n",
    "1. You are responsible for the correctness of your code and should add as many tests as you see fit. Those tests will not be graded nor checked.\n",
    "1. You are free to add code and markdown cells as you see fit.\n",
    "1. Write your functions in this jupyter notebook only. Do not create external python modules and import from them.\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use functions and methods from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/) only, unless otherwise mentioned.\n",
    "1. Your code must run without errors. It is a good idea to restart the notebook and run it from end to end before you submit your exercise.\n",
    "1. Answers to qualitative questions should be written in **markdown cells (with $\\LaTeX$ support)**.\n",
    "1. Submit this jupyter notebook only using your ID as a filename. **No not use ZIP or RAR**. For example, your submission should look like this: `123456789.ipynb` if you worked by yourself or `123456789_987654321.ipynb` if you worked in pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this exercise you will perform the following:\n",
    "1. Practice OOP in python.\n",
    "2. Implement two impurity measures: Gini and Entropy.\n",
    "3. Construct a decision tree algorithm.\n",
    "4. Prune the tree to achieve better results.\n",
    "5. Visualize your results."

We recommend that every node will hold the **feature** and **value** used for the split and the **children** of that node. In addition, it might be a good idea to store the **prediction** in that node, the **height** of the tree for that node and whether or not that node is a **leaf** in the tree.\n",

Determine the threshold for splitting by checking all possible features and the values available for splitting. When considering the values, take the average of each consecutive pair. For example, for the values [1,2,3,4,5] you should test possible splits on the values [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]. \n",
